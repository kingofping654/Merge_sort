# Merge_sort

This Project was reaaaaaaaallllllllyyyyyy annoying for me. I do not really understand recursion super well which made this tough. I also couldn't use print,p,puts to debug because it always broke my code for whatever reason. Fortunately I figured it out and merge sorted some numbers. I still don't fully understand how it works but luckily it does.
